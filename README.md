# Iranian (Persian/Jalali) Date Column For Thunderbird

## This project is archived
Due to API changes in Thunderbird this addon no longer works in verison 68+.

[A new addon](https://github.com/mhdzli/mahour) has been developed by mhdzli which is based on this addon and creates a Persian date column and works perfectly.

## About this addon
This addon creates a new Persian date column for Thunderbird. It only works with Thunderbird version 60.* and below.
